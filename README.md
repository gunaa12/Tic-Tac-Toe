# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Summary

Just a simple Java app where players can play a fun game of Tic Tac Toe. This further reinforces my skills in Object Oriented Programming in Java along with GUI through the use of Java's Swing framework. Also helped me learn event handling through clicks and so on.

## To access the code

1) Download the code by pressing on "Code" and then the "Download ZIP" button.
2) Extract the zip file an open the files in an IDE of your choice.
3) You now have full access (in addition to viewing, you can run the code as well) to all of the code.

## Future Goals

* Improve the GUI further
* Make the code more efficient
* Add a AI player for single player mode
